## 👨‍⚕️ About Me
I work on transforming hospital EMR data into **research-ready surgical datasets**.

Currently, I am building a structured research database based on  
**6 years of surgical EMR data (~300,000 cases)**, inspired by publicly available perioperative research datasets such as INSPIRE and MOVER.

I am also conducting an ongoing study on the association between  
**intraoperative hemodynamic changes during aortic surgery** and  
**30-day postoperative mortality**.
